v 1.0.11, 23/Jan/2021
- pitch halving errors with short audio samples bug fixed. Thanks to 
  Esther Judd-Klabbers for reporting it.

v 1.0.10, 12/Oct/2020
- bug due the spectral pitch standard deviation being equal to 0 fixed.
  Thanks to kwanUm for reporting it.
- SyntaxWarnings in the upsample method from the Pitch object corrected (the "is"
  occurrences in the conditionals were replaced by "==" or "in"). 

v 1.0.9.1, 11/Mar/2020
- the minimum frame length required to use the spline interpolation was increased 
  to 4. Otherwise, due constraits imposed by the spline algorithm itself, the 
  pitch extraction routine would be aborted in the cases where the frame has length 
  equal to 3. Thanks to Richard Hemphill for reporting this issue.

v 1.0.9, 20/Feb/2020
- issue due wrong variable name "dtype" in SignalObj initialization fixed.
  Thanks to Richard Hemphill for reporting it.
- SignalObj objects can now be initialized using kwargs. Additionally, the data 
  output_dtype can also be set using kwargs.

v 1.0.8.1, 09/Jul/2018
- issue caused when a PCM integral data signal is employed to create a SignalObj 
  instance fixed. Thanks to Omar Altayyan for reporting and fixing it.
- calculation of the nbits property of a SignalObj instance modified.

v 1.0.8, 21/Jun/2018
- issue caused by extra unneeded numpy array dimensions in pYAAPT.py fixed. 
  Thanks to Omar Altayyan for reporting and fixing it.
- deprecation warning for the hanning and kaiser windows from scipy fixed. 
  Thanks to Omar Altayyan for reporting and fixing it.
- pip module import issue in setup.py fixed.

v 1.0.7, 27/Jul/2017
- issue with negative indexes in the "crs_corr" function from pYAAPT.py due 
  short frame lengths in the "time_track" function fixed. Thanks to Paritosh 
  Gupta, Puff Kan and tuanad121 for reporting it.
- function "interrupt_main()" replaced by "assert", since that the first one is
  not working properly. Thanks to tuanad121 for reporting and fixing it.
- "frame_lengtht" parameter (renamed to "tda_frame_length") from YAAPT 4.0 
  added.
- default value from the "frame_length" parameter in pYAAPT.py changed from 
  25 ms to 35 ms following the alteration ocurred in the new YAAPT 4.0 MATLAB 
  code.
- default value from the "nccf_thresh1" parameter in pYAAPT.py changed from 
  0.25 to 0.3 following the alteration ocurred in the new YAAPT 4.0 MATLAB code.
- some extra minor alterations in pYAAPT.py from the new YAAPT 4.0 MATLAB code.
- minor alterations in the SHC computation of the "spec_track" function from 
  pYAAPT.py.
- minor correction in the step interpolation of "upsample" method from PitchObj 
  in order to allow compability with Python 3.

v1.0.6.1, 13/Mar/2017
- error due misuse of the numpy's "ones" function in spec_track function from 
  pYAAPT fixed. Thanks to Paritosh Gupta for reporting it.

v1.0.6, 23/Jan/2017
- issue with incorrect high values at the beginning and at the end of 
  PitchObj.samp_interp array fixed. Thanks to Esther Judd-Klabbers for reporting 
  it.

v1.0.5.1, 26/Sep/2016
- print functions updated in order to allow compability with Python 3. Thanks to 
  Javier Villalba García for reporting it.
- "xrange" function replaced by "range" in order to allow compability with 
  Python 3.
- "thread" module replaced by "raise KeyboardInterrupt" in pYAAPT.py and 
  basic_tools.py.
- corrected the "VisibleDeprecationWarning"  regarding the misuse of float 
  numbers as argument to numpy.zeros() and as array indeces in pYAAPT.py.

v1.0.5, 22/Sep/2016
- issue with the interpolation of short voiced frames fixed and also minor 
  corrections in the code. Thanks to Michał Dankiewicz for reporting and fixing
  them.
- "UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap'" issue in setup.py fixed and also an extra 
   workaround to avoid it added. Thanks to Javier Villalba García for reporting 
   it.
- corrected the array lenght mismatch in the edges_finder method from the 
  PitchObj class in pYAAPT.py.
- corrected the "VisibleDeprecationWarning"  regarding the misuse of float 
  numbers as array indeces in pYAAPT.py.
- requirements and classifiers added to setup.py.
- distutils replaced by setuptools in setup.py.

v1.0.4, 13/Jan/2015
- segmentation fault issue in pYAAPT.py fixed.
- online documentation added.

v1.0.3, 23/Dec/2014 
- several bugs related to the analysis of 44,1 kHz files fixed. Thanks to 
  Tomasz Toczyski for reporting them.
- "growing pitch and merit vectors" bug in the peaks function from pYAAPT.py 
  fixed.
- "Stop in Dynamic" exceptions in path1 function from pYAAPT.py removed. They 
  were inherited from the original MATLAB code, but apperently don't have a
  real use or meaning.
-  internal interpolation functions changed from spline to pchip in order to 
  keep the fidelity to the original MATLAB code and also to produce better
  results.
- "pchip" option added and set as default to the PitchObj method "upsample" in
  pYAAPT.py. This interpolation method is favored over "spline" because 
  produces less horrible pitch spikes.
- "single sample upsample" bug in PitchObj method "upsample" from
  pYAAPT.py fixed.
- support for stereo files added.
- documentation updated.

v1.0.2, 27/Nov/2014 
- "missing thread package" bug in basic_tools.py fixed.

v1.0.1, 20/Sep/2014 
- 'f0_min' bug in pYAAPT fixed.
- PitchObj.mean_energy attribute added.
- two SignalObj classes merged into only one.
- minor PEP8, functions and commentaries changes.
- documentation added.

v1.0.0, 10/Sep/2014 
- Initial release.
