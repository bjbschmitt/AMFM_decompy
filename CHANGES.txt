v 1.0.8, 21/Jun/2018
- issue caused by extra unneeded numpy array dimensions in pYAAPT.py fixed. 
  Thanks to Omar Altayyan for reporting and fixing it.
- deprecation warning for the hanning and kaiser windows from scipy fixed. 
  Thanks to Omar Altayyan for reporting and fixing it.
- pip module import issue in setup.py fixed.

v 1.0.7, 27/Jul/2017
- issue with negative indexes in the "crs_corr" function from pYAAPT.py due 
  short frame lengths in the "time_track" function fixed. Thanks to Paritosh 
  Gupta, Puff Kan and tuanad121 for reporting it.
- function "interrupt_main()" replaced by "assert", since that the first one is
  not working properly. Thanks to tuanad121 for reporting and fixing it.
- "frame_lengtht" parameter (renamed to "tda_frame_length") from YAAPT 4.0 
  added.
- default value from the "frame_length" parameter in pYAAPT.py changed from 
  25 ms to 35 ms following the alteration ocurred in the new YAAPT 4.0 MATLAB 
  code.
- default value from the "nccf_thresh1" parameter in pYAAPT.py changed from 
  0.25 to 0.3 following the alteration ocurred in the new YAAPT 4.0 MATLAB code.
- some extra minor alterations in pYAAPT.py from the new YAAPT 4.0 MATLAB code.
- minor alterations in the SHC computation of the "spec_track" function from 
  pYAAPT.py.
- minor correction in the step interpolation of "upsample" method from PitchObj 
  in order to allow compability with Python 3.

v1.0.6.1, 13/Mar/2017
- error due misuse of the numpy's "ones" function in spec_track function from 
  pYAAPT fixed. Thanks to Paritosh Gupta for reporting it.

v1.0.6, 23/Jan/2017
- issue with incorrect high values at the beginning and at the end of 
  PitchObj.samp_interp array fixed. Thanks to Esther Judd-Klabbers for reporting 
  it.

v1.0.5.1, 26/Sep/2016
- print functions updated in order to allow compability with Python 3. Thanks to 
  Javier Villalba García for reporting it.
- "xrange" function replaced by "range" in order to allow compability with 
  Python 3.
- "thread" module replaced by "raise KeyboardInterrupt" in pYAAPT.py and 
  basic_tools.py.
- corrected the "VisibleDeprecationWarning"  regarding the misuse of float 
  numbers as argument to numpy.zeros() and as array indeces in pYAAPT.py.

v1.0.5, 22/Sep/2016
- issue with the interpolation of short voiced frames fixed and also minor 
  corrections in the code. Thanks to Michał Dankiewicz for reporting and fixing
  them.
- "UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap'" issue in setup.py fixed and also an extra 
   workaround to avoid it added. Thanks to Javier Villalba García for reporting 
   it.
- corrected the array lenght mismatch in the edges_finder method from the 
  PitchObj class in pYAAPT.py.
- corrected the "VisibleDeprecationWarning"  regarding the misuse of float 
  numbers as array indeces in pYAAPT.py.
- requirements and classifiers added to setup.py.
- distutils replaced by setuptools in setup.py.

v1.0.4, 13/Jan/2015
- segmentation fault issue in pYAAPT.py fixed.
- online documentation added.

v1.0.3, 23/Dec/2014 
- several bugs related to the analysis of 44,1 kHz files fixed. Thanks to 
  Tomasz Toczyski for reporting them.
- "growing pitch and merit vectors" bug in the peaks function from pYAAPT.py 
  fixed.
- "Stop in Dynamic" exceptions in path1 function from pYAAPT.py removed. They 
  were inherited from the original MATLAB code, but apperently don't have a
  real use or meaning.
-  internal interpolation functions changed from spline to pchip in order to 
  keep the fidelity to the original MATLAB code and also to produce better
  results.
- "pchip" option added and set as default to the PitchObj method "upsample" in
  pYAAPT.py. This interpolation method is favored over "spline" because 
  produces less horrible pitch spikes.
- "single sample upsample" bug in PitchObj method "upsample" from
  pYAAPT.py fixed.
- support for stereo files added.
- documentation updated.

v1.0.2, 27/Nov/2014 
- "missing thread package" bug in basic_tools.py fixed.

v1.0.1, 20/Sep/2014 
- 'f0_min' bug in pYAAPT fixed.
- PitchObj.mean_energy attribute added.
- two SignalObj classes merged into only one.
- minor PEP8, functions and commentaries changes.
- documentation added.

v1.0.0, 10/Sep/2014 
- Initial release.
